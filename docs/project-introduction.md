# Introduction

**EquiSight** is a tool targeted at retail investors, aiming to fix some of the many pain points experienced by them that have long been a barrier of entry turning people away from a sensible way to grow one's money.

In this documentation, the reader will be walked through the entire design process behind EquiSight, starting from its conception to its final incarnation. This includes a complete description of the major features and design decisions made and executed in the creation of this application.

## Aim

EquiSight aims to be an all-in-one personal assistant for retail investors, alleviating major pain points and eradicating barriers to entry that they are highly likely to face.

## Problem

Investment has always been a loaded and complicated topic. Many would-be retail investors have been turned away by the sheer complexity of it all, ending their pursuit of financial wellbeing before it has even started. We identify the major barriers to entry as:
- *Time*: Retail investors lack a significant amount of time to spend monitoring their assets and the news in a consistent and reliable manner. Furthermore, retail investors often don't have the time to learn and interpret outputs from highly-specialised analysis tools. Such people are not professional investors; they work other jobs, and do not have the luxury of time to monitor the market and can only manage their own portfolios on their own time. This often means very little time.
- *Risk*: Retail investment requires one to front their own hard-earned cash. With a high degree of uncertainty, compounded by the lack of time to learn and study the market, people are turned away or pushed towards the least risky option: letting their cash idle.
- *Knowledge*: Sound investment requires understanding fundamentals, but too often it is overcomplicated and unfriendly for beginners; too often does it also scare away beginners, by making them think they require more knowledge than they really need to make sound decisions.

In a different vein, more experienced retail investors seeking to make more precise decisions also face many similar barriers, except that these barriers manifet differently.
- *Time*: Experienced retail investors might seek to use analysis tools to aid their decision-making. But there are only really two approaches presently to this: either go all out with investment platforms that often have massive feature sets and parameters for the user to contend with, or 'roll your own solution' by using tools for mathematical analysis, which may involve programming languages and complicated libraries.
- *Risk*: Sound financial analysis can help reduce risk. On the contrary, inability to access financial analysis tools in turn increases the risk an experienced retail investor has to take on.
- *Knowledge*: The execution of financial analysis and interpretation of its results is separate from its implementation. But when the only alternatives are to either use incredibly complicated and overblown tools or to spend an immense amount of time learning to build a customised solution, having knowledge of financial analysis becomes useless because putting it to practice is infeasible.

## Proposed Solution

EquiSight attempts to fix all of this. It primarily intends to consolidate all of the tools that a retail investor might use or want to learn to use in a single place. That way, it serves as a one-stop shop for all a retail investor's needs, saving them a significant amount of time in the process.

We focus also on simplifying features to only what is largely necessary, but make them no simpler. This is to bridge the gap between rudimentary solutions (barebones market data) and overly complex solutions (investment platforms and tools).
